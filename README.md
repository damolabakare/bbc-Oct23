# Hello Users

This is a base template for our workshop on Creating a Multi page website

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file.

← `mistakes.html`: This is a simple HTML page with some errors that we will be correcting during the workshop

← `index.html`: This is the main HTML page for your site we will be building on.

← `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content.

← `script.js`: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript.
